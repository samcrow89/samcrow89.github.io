          <h3>About me</h3>
          <div class="inner-1">
            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
I'm Bryan Search. I was born in Mainz, Germany in 1989 and grew up in a small town called Auerbach in der Oberpfalz as the son of German mother and a American father. I went to school in Eschenbach and got my Abitur(the highest German school graduation) in 2010. 
</p>
<p>
After that I studied physics(B.S.) at the University of Bayreuth for a semester, until I realized that the lack of creative working in a scientific field couldn't satisfy the expectations I had in life. I had the chance to study at my university without a major subject for one semester and I used that to revue all the scientific fields that my university had to offer. I then soon found the faculty of media science and was amazed! I never thought of movies, games and TV-series as a possible working area before, and as soon as it struck my mind I knew that's what I want to do.
</p>
<p>
So in the Fall of 2011 I enrolled in Media Science and Media Practice(B.A.) with Applied Computer Science as my minor subject. There I started to work with video manipulation and soon get into visual effects. Later I switched my focus to game design and game development and got particularly interested in innovative game mechanics and their relation to level design. I also started programming my own games mostly in Unity, because it was free, powerful and easy to learn. I used it to test different game play concepts and learned a lot about remixing and adaption with experiments like building a board game version of the classic arcade game “Frogger” or making a 3D puzzle game based on sound design instead of graphics. Besides that, I got to know the toolchains and workflows of sound design, modelling and texturing. Even though I never got serious in these areas, I mention that because I think it's essential to know the workloads of your coworkers if you don't want to extend your deadline as a scrum master or producer.
</p>
<p>
At the moment I focus on AI programming. Therefore I wrote an A.I. for a stragety/shooter game in Unity that can handle up to 90 NPC and is freely expandable in its behavior because of the efficient way of decision making.
</p>
<p>
So much for now.
</p>
<p>
Bryan Search
